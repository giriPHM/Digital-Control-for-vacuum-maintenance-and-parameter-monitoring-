#Please read all of it before operating the system!

This is the project for controlling the vacuum system and retreiving some system properties like pressure, temperature of the chip,etc.

To operate it, you have to run the operate.py from the terminal. If you are using the raspberry Pi currently being used in the big lab, you have to find operate.py in the GUI_file directory in the home directory and run "operate.py".

You will see a GUI appear and you can see Display_kickoff in the middle. Press the button to see the system parameters. Follow the start and stop button associated with the respective TURBO or Roughing pump to turn them on. 

Be sure to turn both the power supply on before doing all this!
